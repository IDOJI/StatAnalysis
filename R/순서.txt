So the way the PWS survey works is it has broken into a series of positive statements (such as "My physical health is excellent") and negative (ex: "I am uncertain about my ability to do things well in the future."). 


Each respondent rates how accurately the statements represent themselves, 
then these are scored between 1-6. 

For the positive statements, the most accurate statement is given a 6 and the least accurate is given a 1, and for the negative statements a score of 6 is given for the least accurate and 1 for the most accurate.




 So theoretically the higher score, the more accurate the positive statements are and the less accurate the negative statements are, and the higher the respondent's wellness. 
 
These responses are broken into 6 different subcategories (a sum of 6 different questions, the Psy_Sum, Emo_Sum, scores respectively), which represent individual parameters in wellness. 
 
Each of these subsections were added together to get the "wellness magnitude". So magnitude is just a rough score of all the question responses added together for each subsection.
 
The survey then has specific steps utilized to take just these scores to come up with the wellness quotient (which is roughly the "wellness magnitude" corrected for variance), which is the end product of the PWS. They have the full step-by-step guide to this scoring and calculation here. https://perceivedwellness.com/scoring/
 
Most of the ANOVAs that were run were just for the Wellness score, not Magnitude or the subscores. 
 
So in summary:
PsySum, etc: Sum score for the 6 subsections.
Magnitude: Sum score for all 6 subsections added up.
Wellness Quotient: Final output of the survey, roughly magnitude corrected for variance (on which we did our ANOVAs)
 
 
Hopefully this helped. I definitely recommend checking out their website, its not perfect, but hopefully will help. Feel free to reach out with any other questions!
